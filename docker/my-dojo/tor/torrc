## Tor opens a socks proxy on port 9050 by default -- even if you don't
## configure one below. Set "SocksPort 0" if you plan to run Tor only
## as a relay, and not make any local application connections yourself.

# Socks is only available from dojonet
SocksPort 172.28.1.4:9050

## Entry policies to allow/deny SOCKS requests based on IP address.
## First entry that matches wins. If no SocksPolicy is set, we accept
## all (and only) requests that reach a SocksPort. Untrusted users who
## can access your SocksPort may be able to learn about the connections
## you make.

# Socks is only available from dojonet
SocksPolicy accept 172.28.0.0/16
SocksPolicy reject *

## The directory for keeping all the keys/etc. By default, we store
## things in $HOME/.tor on Unix, and in Application Data\tor on Windows.

DataDirectory /var/lib/tor/.tor

## The port on which Tor will listen for local connections from Tor
## controller applications, as documented in control-spec.txt.

ControlPort 9051

## If you enable the controlport, be sure to enable one of these
## authentication methods, to prevent attackers from accessing it.
